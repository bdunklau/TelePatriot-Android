How to send text to emulator:

Launch emulator
Navigate to screen where you want to enter data
Click on the EditText field to bring up the keyboard

Go to Terminal in Android Studio (at the bottom left)

WINDOWS:
cd c:\Users\bdunklau\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools
Type this at the prompt:  adb shell input text "hi"
ENTER


MAC:
cd /Users/bdunklau/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools
Type this at the prompt:  ./adb shell input text "hi"
ENTER


You should see hi appear in the EditText field

(Now you can get rid of that Paste button :)
